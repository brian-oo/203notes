### Coding for example

For example, please look in your `int main` function. Some other examples of functions are:
```C++
int main(){
    cout << "Hello World" << endl;
}
```

Let's make a list of what we've done so far
* Nothing
* Everything
* Something

3. Maybe
4. Almost

1. First item
   1. Sub items
   2. Are so weird
2. Second item

 Propositions | Truth Values
 :---: | :---:
 p | true = 1
 q | false = 0

Take a look at this weird science thing:
